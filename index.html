  <p align="justify"> Supported by the Civitan International Research Center (CIRC), the Neurodevelopmental Bioinformatics
    Initiative (NBI) is an interdisciplinary resources available to many researchers in campus in the design and analysis
    of high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic studies. The support provided by the NBI core helps advance Civitan's
    mission to expand our knowledge of neurodevelopmental and intellectual disabilities. Importantly, as an interdisciplinary
    resource, the NBI extends the support level provided by the CIRC to several research domains.</p>
  <h1 style="color:#1E6B52;font-size:30px;"><strong>About the Neurodevelopmental Bioinformatics Initiative (NBI)</strong>:</h1>
  <p align="justify">The NBI was formally established in 2016 by the Civitan International Research Center to
    support researchers interested in the utilization of high-throughput genomic technologies to enhance our knowledge
    of neurodevelopmental and intellectual disabilities. The utilization of next-generation sequencing technology
    provides an in-depth opportunity to study the molecular alterations and mechanisms related to disabilities such as
    Down syndrome, autism, Fragile X syndrome, epilepsy, and Rett syndrome.</p>
  <p align="justify">Today, the NBI is an interdisciplinary resource to researches across several departments to support
    their bioinformatics needs from a wide-range of next-generation sequencing applications including bulk RNA-seq,
    epigenomics and single-cell/single-nuclei sequencing. In order to analyze the data in a reproducible and scalable
    manner the NBI applies robust practices such as 1) maintainance of all pipelines and project specific code at
    <a href="https://gitlab.rc.uab.edu/">UAB's GitLab instance</a> for version control 2) employment of
    <a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Snakemake</a>
    as our workflow mangament system 3) execution of computationally heavy jobs at
    <a href="https://www.uab.edu/it/home/research-computing">UAB's High Performance Computing (HPC)</a> cluster, named Cheaha.
    Further, we are happy to provide project-specific support and discuss with investigators experimental designs, data
    visualization needs and provide help in manuscript and grant support.
    To see more details on our services and workflow representation, please visit our
    <a href="https://circ-nbi.github.io/services/"><strong>"Services page"</strong></a></p>
  <p align="justify">As the bioinformatics field rapidly advances, the NBI will ensure that the most updated methods
    are applied to ongoing and future studies by the Civitan scientists.</p>
  <h1 style="color:#1E6B52;font-size:30px;"><strong>Additional Information</strong>:</h1>
  <p align="justify">For institutional investigators outside of the CIRC and Neurobiology, a close partner for the NBI is the
    UAB Biological Data Science (U-BDS) institutional core. U-BDS offers services across genomics and transcriptomics applications
    and more information about it can be found at: </p>
