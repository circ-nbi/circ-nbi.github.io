## NBI model of services:
-------------

* __Next-generation sequencing analysis:__ The long-term commitment of the NBI is to provide robust and reproducible
pipelines for numerous omics applications. Currently, the NBI provides support for several transcriptomics
applications, such as bulk RNA-seq (whole-transcriptome, mRNA), single-cell/nuclei RNA-seq, CITE-seq and epigenomics
applications such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and
immunoprecipitation sequencing techniques such as MeDIP-seq, MBD-seq, ChIP-seq.
* __Visualization of omics data:__ Presenting the wealth of information from an omics study is crucial for scientists to
effectively relay their data. The NBI produces high-quality figures from omics data.
* __Support for writing manuscripts and grant applications:__ Formal assistance is provided during the writing/reviewing
stages of manuscript and grants to ensure that the bioinformatics methods and data are properly described.
* __Project-specific requests such as writting R Shiny applications.__ See our [__"Ratlas"__](https://day-lab.shinyapps.io/ratlas/) app written for Dr. Jeremy Day, Department of Neurobiology, as an example.
* __Bioinformatics training:__ The NBI is happy to provide group or one-on-one training sessions to aid the community in the
utilization of bioinformatics resources.

__NOTE__: In collaboration with Dr. Brittany Lasseigne and her lab, we are developing a series of introductory guides for data science and also providing weekly open office hours for UAB trainees, faculty and staff every Thursday from 3:30pm - 4:00pm. All educational materials and more information on the open office hours are being hosted at Dr. Lasseigne's website at: [https://www.lasseigne.org/education/](https://www.lasseigne.org/education/)
